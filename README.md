# Flight Tracking App
An application that tracks flights across the globe. By the use of OpenSky Network API'S, the application fetches GEOJSON data and renders it on a map implemented by MapBoxGL. User can also  search for a plane using its unique identifier known as an ICAO24 number to track the airplane and see its activities filtered with a beginning and an end date.
